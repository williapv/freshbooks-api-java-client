[FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com) is a popular online invoicing application.  As part of integrating [Clarity Accounting](http://www.clarityaccounting.com) with FreshBooks I had to write a Java library to access it with.

Rather than keep this code to myself, I thought I'd share it, just in case other people are writing code to use the FreshBooks API.
